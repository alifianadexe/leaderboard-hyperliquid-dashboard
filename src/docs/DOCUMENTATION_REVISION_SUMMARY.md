# README Documentation Revision Summary

## Overview

Completely revised the README.md documentation to reflect the current rate-limiting optimized architecture with WebSocket-based discovery and batched tracking.

## Major Changes Made

### 🏗️ **Architecture Section Updates**

- **Updated Architecture Diagram**: Shows WebSocket connections, batched processing, and rate-safe design
- **Added Rate Limiting Strategy**: Explains zero-cost WebSocket discovery and controlled batching
- **Enhanced Component Descriptions**: Details on batch processing (50 traders/75s) and queue management

### 🔄 **Application Flow Revision**

- **Service 1**: Changed from HTTP polling to WebSocket-based real-time discovery
- **Service 2**: Updated to batched processing with detailed rate limiting explanation
- **Service 3**: Kept leaderboard calculation unchanged but updated examples
- **Added Rate Limiting Compliance**: Clear breakdown of safe vs controlled operations

### 🗄️ **Database Schema Updates**

- **Added Critical Index**: `idx_traders_last_tracked_batching` for queue management
- **Enhanced Trade Events**: Updated event types to match new detection logic
- **Added Documentation**: Explained JSONB storage and indexing strategy

### 🌐 **API Endpoints Revision**

- **Added Rate Impact Column**: Shows which endpoints are rate-safe vs removed
- **Removed Rate-Limited Endpoints**: Clearly marked removed trader tracking endpoint
- **Updated WebSocket Endpoint**: Changed from `/ws/v1/trades` to `/ws/v1/updates`
- **Added System Stats**: New `/api/v1/stats` endpoint documentation
- **Enhanced WebSocket Examples**: Detailed message formats with real examples

### ⚙️ **Configuration Updates**

- **Added New Environment Variables**: `BATCH_SIZE` and `WEBSOCKET_URL`
- **Updated Task Schedule**: Revised Celery beat schedule with new timings
- **Added Rate Impact Indicators**: Shows which config affects rate limiting

### 📊 **Performance Features Addition**

- **Rate Limiting Compliance**: Detailed explanation of weight management
- **Database Optimization**: Index usage and batch processing efficiency
- **Real-time System**: WebSocket and Redis pub/sub performance details

### 📈 **Monitoring Section**

- **System Statistics**: How to monitor application health
- **Key Metrics**: What to watch for rate limiting and performance
- **Health Check Endpoints**: Available monitoring endpoints
- **Logging Guidance**: Recommended log levels for production
